This is a simple welcome/home page, the "html.index file" designed with HTML tags, and elements, also CSS. The centered forms are links wrapped with <ul> </ul> tags. Clicking any of these links opens a new web page on the same tab for forms to be completed inorder to fetch information from the database.
