# PHP-database-driven-web-development
Please check out my database driven website designed with PHP, HTML5, CSS and MySQL. I developed a website with PHP, HTML5, CSS and MySQL that would interact with a family database on MySQL (MariaDB) server to update, edit, delete data in the database through an HTML form and output pictures from the database.
